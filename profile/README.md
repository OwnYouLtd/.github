### Vision

We are building core [architecture](https://www.ownyou.io/docs/what/) for individuals to harvest their own personal data, make it available to third party machine learning entities (the [Intelligence Stack](https://www.ownyou.io/docs/intelligence_stack/)) to extract and monetize intelligent personal profiles, in a privacy preserving manner.

The OwnYou [documentation](www.ownyou.io) will help you better understand our vision and how the architecture works.

We want this to remain an open source project. Your contribution will bring OwnYou to life.

Ultimately, OwnYou will form the base personal data layer for intelligent personal AI. But before we get to that, we need to figure out:

- how to efficiently harvest an individual's personal data into secure decentralized storage,
- how to make that data available to third party machine learning algorithms, and
- how to help individuals share, and monetize, their intelligent profiles with advertisers, and other commercial opportunities, in a privacy preserving manner.

### First things first

- We need to get OwnYou into individual user hands as soon as possible, helping them to collect their personal data and helping them to extract intelligent profiles.
- We want publishers to use the OwnYou login button, helping individuals get access to high quality content in exchange for sharing those profiles.
- We want advertisers to learn and use our new attribution framework.

All of this needs to come together in a minimal viable product (MVP).
More detailed requirements for this MVP will emerge in the Projects section, before becoming Pull Requests, and then product.
We encourage discussions in the [Discussion](https://github.com/OwnYouLtd/.github/discussions) section or in [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/960473414978646036/960473414978646040).

### Contributing to the discussion

There are a few ways you can discuss new ideas and contributions to the architecture. If you want to use Discord, the following channels might help focus the dicussion:

- [Intelligence Stack](https://discord.com/channels/960473414978646036/986321483884294315), a community of independent machine learning experts, extracting intelligence from private personal data.
- [Decentralized Storage](https://discord.com/channels/960473414978646036/986321420273459330), that allows individuals to store their raw personal data in a secure manner and run third party machine learning algorithms in a privacy preserving manner.
- [Digital Advertising](https://discord.com/channels/960473414978646036/1078613236741574696) using OwnYou's privacy preserving, equitable, personal data
- [Other applications](https://discord.com/channels/960473414978646036/1078613645673648138) that leverage intelligent privacy preserving personal data
- [Incentivization](https://discord.com/channels/960473414978646036/1078614046808481843) architecture that compensates the intelligence stack, compute and storage suppliers, and individuals for sharing their personal, albeit pseudonymous, data.

### Building stuff

We review contributions to the codebase via GitHub's Pull Request mechanism. We have the following guidelines to ease your experience and help our leads respond quickly to your valuable work:

* Start by proposing a change either in Issues (most appropriate for small change requests or bug fixes) or in Discussions (most appropriate for design and architecture considerations, proposing a new feature, or where you'd like insight and feedback) or in Discord.
* Cultivate consensus around your ideas; the project leads will help you pre-flight how beneficial the proposal might be to the project. Developing early buy-in will help others understand what you're looking to do, and give you a greater chance of your contributions making it into the codebase! No one wants to see work done in an area that's unlikely to be incorporated into the codebase.
* Fork the repo into your own namespace/remote
* Work in a dedicated feature branch. Atlassian wrote a great [description of this workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)
* When you're ready to offer your work to the project, first:
  * Squash your commits into a single one (or an appropriate small number of commits), and rebase atop the upstream `main` branch. This will limit the potential for merge conflicts during review, and helps keep the audit trail clean. A good writeup for how this is done is [here](https://medium.com/@slamflipstrom/a-beginners-guide-to-squashing-commits-with-git-rebase-8185cf6e62ec), and if you're having trouble - feel free to ask a member or the community for help or leave the commits as-is, and flag that you'd like rebasing assistance in your PR! We're here to support you.
  * Open a PR in the project to bring in the code from your feature branch.
  * The maintainers noted in the `CODEOWNERS` file will review your PR and optionally open a discussion about its contents before moving forward.
* Remain responsive to follow-up questions, be open to making requested changes, and...You're a contributor!
* And remember to respect everyone in our global development community. Guidelines are established in our `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

### Please remember

- Treat everyone with respect. Absolutely no harassment,  sexism, racism, or hate speech will be tolerated.
- No NSFW or obscene content. This includes text, images, or links featuring nudity, sex, violence, or other graphically disturbing content.
- If you see something that makes you feel unsafe, let me know. We want this community to be a welcoming one!
- No spam or self-promotion (advertisements etc).
