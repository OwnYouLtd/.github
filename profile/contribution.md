### Contributions

There are a few ways you can discuss new ideas and contributions to the architecture. You can submit a new issue in this repo, or a more relevant OwnYou repo, you can create a new discussion or or you can drop into the relevant Discord channel:

- [Intelligence Stack](https://discord.com/channels/960473414978646036/986321483884294315), a community of independent machine learning experts, extracting intelligence from private personal data.
- [Decentralized Storage](https://discord.com/channels/960473414978646036/986321420273459330), that allows individuals to store their raw personal data in a secure manner and run third party machine learning algorithms in a privacy preserving manner.
- [Digital Advertising](https://discord.com/channels/960473414978646036/1078613236741574696) using OwnYou's privacy preserving, equitable, personal data
- [Other applications](https://discord.com/channels/960473414978646036/1078613645673648138) that leverage intelligent privacy preserving personal data
- [Incentivization](https://discord.com/channels/960473414978646036/1078614046808481843) architecture that compensates the intelligence stack, compute and storage suppliers, and individuals for sharing their personal, albeit pseudonymous, data.
